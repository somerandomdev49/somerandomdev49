### _Hello_ :doughnut:

I'm not active here. Check out [@monomere](https://github.com/monomere), new projects are mostly there.

Some projects (abandoned mostly):
* [gitlab/monos](https://gitlab.com/somerandomdev49/monos) - a non-posix *nano*kernel.
* [tinylang](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/tinylang) - golfing programing language in C with it's own register VM. (very WIP)
* [wlang](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/wlang) - more serious programming language in C that compiles to x86_64 (less WIP)
* [microl](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/microl) - an interpreted language written in C.
* [mini-core](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/mini-core) - somewhat complete OpenGL rendering engine.
