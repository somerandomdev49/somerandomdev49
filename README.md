I'm currently working on many things at once!

But mainly on a C++ engine and game (private repo, [temporary website](https://dragoncore-game.web.app))

Side-projects that I'm maybe working on:
* [PlainOS](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/PlainOS) - a non-POSIX microkernel.
* [gitlab/monos](https://gitlab.com/somerandomdev49/monos) - a non-posix *nano*kernel, testing grounds for PlainOS.
* [tulc](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/tulc) - a non-strict C superset, will probably rewrite PlainOS in it.

Side-projects that I'm supposed to be working on, but I'm too lazy:
* [tinylang](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/tinylang) - golfing programing language in C with it's own register VM. (very WIP)
* [wlang](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/wlang) - more serious programming language in C that compiles to x86_64 (less WIP)

Some of my *finished* (no) projects:
* [microl](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/microl) - an interpreted language written in C.
* [mini-core](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/mini-core) - somewhat complete OpenGL rendering engine.

> Basically all repos here are unfinshed projects.
