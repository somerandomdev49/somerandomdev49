### _Hello_ :doughnut:

I'm currently working on many things at once!

One of my long-term projects is a game written in C++, developed with a small team of friends. The engine (rewrite!) is called CoreEngine because I was too lazy to think of a better name :/ [repo](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/CoreEngine)

Side-projects that I'm sometimes working on:
* [PlainOS](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/PlainOS) - a non-POSIX microkernel.
* [gitlab/monos](https://gitlab.com/somerandomdev49/monos) - a non-posix *nano*kernel, testing grounds for PlainOS.

Side-projects that I'm supposed to be working on, but I'm too lazy:
* [tinylang](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/tinylang) - golfing programing language in C with it's own register VM. (very WIP)
* [wlang](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/wlang) - more serious programming language in C that compiles to x86_64 (less WIP)
* [tulc](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/tulc) - a non-strict C superset, will probably rewrite PlainOS in it.

Some of my *finished* (no) projects:
* [microl](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/microl) - an interpreted language written in C.
* [mini-core](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/mini-core) - somewhat complete OpenGL rendering engine.

> Basically all repos here are half-working projects.
