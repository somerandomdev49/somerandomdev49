I'm currently working on many things at once!
But mainly on a C++ game (private repo)

Some of my *finished* (no) projects:
* [microl](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/microl) - an interpreted language written in C
* [mini-core](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/mini-core) - somewhat complete OpenGL rendering engine

Side-projects I'm working on:
* [tinylang](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/tinylang) - golfing programing language in C with it's own register VM. (very WIP)
* [wlang](https://github.com/somerandomdev49/wlang) - more serious programming language in C that compiles to x86_64 (less WIP)

> Basically all repos here are unfinshed projects.
